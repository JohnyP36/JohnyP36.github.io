# Favorite Sites

This is my website. Click [here](https://johnyp36.github.io/) to see it.

~I need some help with transfering my website [Favorite Sites](https://sites.google.com/view/fav-sites) to Github pages.~  
I have successfully transferred my site to a github page. A lot of the code, however, is not human readable and needs to be simplified. Also as some code is unnecessary extensive.  
This costs me a lot of time, which I don't have. 
##### So please help with a PR or opening issues

> Use the template that has been made available for this.
> #### Don't pull a request for just one or two (max. four issues). Only pull request if there are a lot of changes at once.
> 
> ##### VERY IMPORTANT! Changing files in the folder `.github` will put you at the risk of being blocked. Only change files in the `/docs`-folder.
> ---
> ### _Commit message_
> Keep it simple. 
>  1. Put in the title box `A:` if something is added, `C` for changing something, a `R` for removing something and a `M` if something is moved to another file . 
>  2. Put here after the file name of the file you changed
>  3. At the end put the issue number if appliable. 
> So `C: docs/index.html fix #74` or `R: docs/images/... fix #75`. The issue itself will contains all the details.
